# Social Android Security
## Why
This project is a two-in-one: my [senior project](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/courses/seniorprojects) for my Computer Science degree, and also my [Nathan Award](https://www.engg.ksu.edu/ergp/undergrad_research/nathan_award/)-funded research in the [Machine Learning and Data Science Lab](http://caragea-wiki.cs.ksu.edu/doku.php) at K-State. The research is advised by Prof. [Doina Caragea](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~dcaragea/).

See predecessor research works on my [academic homepage](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~jdeloach). Learn more about me on my [personal webpage](http://jordandeloach.com).

## How
The project focuses on exploring if, and how, social media can be leveraged to improve traditional classifier approaches to detecting malicious Android apps. Some of the pivotal questions raised include how does one connect that a given tweet (out of millions) is relevant to a certain app (out of millions)? Is what is said substantive in determining the maliciousness or non-maliciousness of that app?

See the (very informal) initial project proposal [presentation](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~jdeloach/downloads/cs598.pptx).
